## Prerequisites

- Teleport v(=teleport.version) Open Source or Enterprise.

## Step 1. Import the Teleport CA into Github

In order to export the Teleport CA, execute

```code
tctl auth export > teleport.ca
```

Then follow the steps outlined[here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-your-organizations-ssh-certificate-authorities),
to import the exported Teleport CA

## Step 2. Configure key extensions to be included in key generation.

Create or update a role to include the `cert_extensions` option.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  options:
     cert_extensions:
       - type: ssh
         mode: extension
         name: login@github.com
         value: "{{ external.logins }}"
```

## Step 3. Issue a user certificate.

A user certificate may be issued with the following command 

```code
tctl auth sign --out out.cer --user=$USERNAME
```
