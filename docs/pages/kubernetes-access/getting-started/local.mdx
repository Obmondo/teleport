title: Get Started with Teleport on Kubernetes
description: Use this local demo to get started with Teleport on Kubernetes in 10 minutes.
---

In this guide, we will show you how to set up Teleport on a local Kubernetes cluster. You will see how Teleport enables users to access private resources in your cluster, all from a single ingress port, so you can configure authentication, authorization, and audit.

Our demo will run on minikube, a local Kubernetes deployment. The cluster will run the Kubernetes-supported web-based dashboard, which is accessible via a Service open only to other resources in the cluster. One pod will run the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service. Another pod will run the Teleport Application Service and enable access to the dashboard to authorized end-users.

## Prerequisites
While this guide deploys resources only on your local development machine, you will need access to the public Internet.

Make sure that the following tools are installed on your local machine.
